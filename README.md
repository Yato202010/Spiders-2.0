# Spider 2.0

This is the NOT a continuation of TheCyberBrick's original mod . 
This repository have been created to keep this mod working for my private modpack while i update it to new minecraft version.
You can sometime expect some minor update and fix but no big rework

## Features
Vanilla spiders are not yet creepy enough for you? You wish spiders would actually climb properly!
With Spiders 2.0 you dive into a world where intelligent arachnids crawl along walls and ceilings, finding their way around almost any obstacle to haunt you.
Combined with a Resource Pack like scarier spiders and a realistic shader, you can experience what one of the most feared animals can do in your favorite block game too.
